        <Text>The peasants are the basic infantry of the Empire.
Though weak and poorly trained, they are numerous.
Peasants are an important source of revenue for their masters.

The archers of the Griffin Empire excel in the art of overwhelming the enemy with barrages of arrows.

These creatures of Light are fierce in combat and their attacks are always deadly. An angel cannot be killed, if its body is endangered it will return to its spirit form and rejoin its master.

        <Text>Fury drives the Hell Hound to move quickly around the battlefield, striking with great strength and anger.
Their rage when fighting is also a weakness, however.
Hell Hounds care little for their own safety and leave themselves vulnerable in order to focus all their energy on the attack.

        <Text>Necromancers who wish to cheat death become Vampires with ever-youthful -- but empty -- bodies.
Any damage that Vampires inflict upon the living heals their own immortal forms. Gifted with hundreds of years of combat experience, they are so swift with their swords than none can retaliate against their strikes.

        <Text>Golems are ancient magical constructs that are used as primary battle units by the Silver Cities.
Golems are armed with two long curved swords, and their substance is their armour.
Iron golems are impervious to slowing effects - they really can't get much slower - and are well protected against magic
(all damage from such attacks is halved).

        <Text>Some of the Wizards of the Silver Cities serve in the army.
They are weak in close combat, being armed only with a dagger and unskilled at melee fighting.
This weakness, however, is more than compensated for by the power of their spells.
They can fire blasts of pure magical energy that damage any creature in their way - including friendly ones.
They also carry scrolls with additional spells on them.

        <Text>Colossi are the most powerful creatures that can be built or summoned by the Wizards.
They are created using the same basic method as golems, but on a much larger scale.
Each Colossus also hosts a figment of the soul of his creator.
This unwavering will makes them immune to mind-controlling magic, assuring the Wizards of their unquestionable loyalty.
Not fond of weapons, Colossi deal heavy blows to their opponents using their massive hands and close combat feats
